## My process
I'm building this project with React and Tailwind. I'm currently building it in a function before form approach, so I'll try to make it look better once I've implemented all the technical stuff.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- Vite

### To do

- Add more details to modal popup
- Implement descending order for both sort types
- Better UI design
  - Card color based on type
  - Cards show type icon
- Who's that pokemon mini game: button that shows random pokemon silhouette 
- Show strengths and weaknesses of each pokemon
